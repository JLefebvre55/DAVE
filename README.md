# DAVE

DAVE - or the *"Deterministic Agriculture Virtualization Environment"* - is a controlled-environment micro-greenhouse designed to grow and collect data on wasabi. Based upon the work of [MIT Media Lab’s Open Agriculture Initiative](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/).

By synchronizing existing botanical *Wasabia japonica* research across all environment variables (See below) and comparing yield and quality to commercial samples, analysis can be done on the relative efficacy of "food computers" for wasabi agriculture.

## Research Paper

Originally an AP Capstone project, "DAVE: Optimizing Wasabi Agriculture Through Automation and Successive Approximation" was published in September of 2019.
